# Neeval Kumar

This project is a in the work production of a full stack web application. It builds my experiences in full stacking engineering like backend, front end, and information security.

# The Application

The project is a gardening application that allows users to store data about their plants and gardening practices. They can create a portfolio for their garden, checking in on times to water, seasons to plant, and other useful tips. Functions like best matainence practices might be implemeneted in later releases through some ML algorithms.

<h1> The structure   </h1>
<p> This application uses NextJs for the majority of the client side and server side programming. It uses Recoil for state management, and MongoDB for the backend cloud database. Tailwind is used for fast css styling. Currently for authentication, I am using a database authentication style that develops my own token for experience's sake, but if I ever do deploy, then I might use a framework like Auth0. Deployment will take awhile because I have to make sure the website follows top security practices like middleware, token authorization, and other things.  </p>

# Next.js + Tailwind CSS Example

This example shows how to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) [(v3.0)](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v3) with Next.js. It follows the steps outlined in the official [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs).
