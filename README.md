# Neeval Kumar

This project is a in the work production of a full stack web application. It builds my experiences in full stacking engineering like backend, front end, and information security.

# The Application

The project is a gardening application that allows users to store data about their plants and gardening practices. They can create a portfolio for their garden, checking in on times to water, seasons to plant, and other useful tips. Functions like best matainence practices might be implemented in later releases through some ML algorithms.

<h1> The structure   </h1>

<p> This application uses NextJs for the majority of the client side and server side programming and MongoDB for the backend cloud database. Tailwind is used for fast css styling, along with some Materials UI for front-end web designing. Currently for authentication, I am using a database authentication style that gives an encrypted token which is then set as a js-cookie. This token will give access to the user for certain elements in the database.

# Known Issues

Logging out from root page does not change navbar to login/signup

## Preview My App so far

Preview the example live on [StackBlitz]():

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/Neev1108/Gardenly)

Please use Google Chrome to view website on stackblitz.
Stackblitz might have problems making api calls so best way to test program right now is to pull and run. Then check localhost:3000

```
npm run dev

```
